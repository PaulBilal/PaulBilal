# SHAPEAI MERN Stack Bootcamp



Hi I made projects during the 6 months MERN Stack Bootcamp, conducted by <b> SHAPEAI </b>.

The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (a Data Analyst at Jio). I got to learn a lot during those couple of months and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:

<li>HTML

<li>CSS

<li>JavaScript

<li>Mongo DB

<li>Express JS

<li>React JS

<li>ode JS

<br>during those couple of months, and everything was explained from the very basics so that anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
